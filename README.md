## Smart Pricing for Used Cars

   Ever wonder how much your car is worth? Well, now you can find out! In this notebook is a smart pricing tool for
   a used car dataset scraped from Craigslist. Included in the notebook are all the links that inspired this notebook
   as well as the link to the data. A requirements.txt is included for reproducibility.

   The model is fairly accurate, but there is alot more work to go into this kernel. A few future pieces of work I
   plan on doing.
    - Hyperparamter optimization with something like HyperOpt
    - Applying inverse transforms on some of the data shown in the LIME explainations
    - Trying a few more models like SVMs
